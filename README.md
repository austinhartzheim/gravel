# Gravel for humans

Gravel is an easy-to-use issue tracker designed for humans and robots. Gravel allows for robots and humans to interact at the same level through use of an API and webhooks. Robots can provide numerous benefits to human life:

* Automated reporting and tracking of problems: Scripts report and track improvements on common problems, including unit tests, website completeness, database validity, etc.
* Automated analysis: Robots can attempt search for statistically significant outliers or matches on predefined rules that are likely causes of problems.
* Pre-Investigation monitoring: Robots can monitor reported data items and report on changes before a human becomes involved.
* Problem routing: Instantly direct problems to the correct people or department through keyword and tag analysis. Track back bugs to the author with `git blame`.

# Gravel for robots

Gravel is also designed with the future in mind. It can enhance the lives of the robot overlords:

* Management of human resources: assign tasks to one or many humans and status updates as their labor completes.
* Coordination of concurrent tasks: monitor dependency trees and completion percentages to estimate time remaining.
* Identity management: track compliance by identity to more effectively distribute cohesive force.
